## Design


### Color Scheme

![Color Scheme](<assets/docs/doyouknowhans.png>)
### Thoughts behind choosing this color scheme:
Because i use the same background image on every page i wanted to find a color scheme that was through a color color picked from the background. I used adobe color wheel for this and found a good color shceme. I felt that it was enough variation with 3 colors, creating a constant theme, the background has quite a lot so felt like more colors would be too much and maybe create too much separation through the entire theme of the project.



### Typography
Fonts

#### Protest Revolution
The font's i've used are standard:
Verdana
Monospace
Impact


### Imagery

I've used one background image as a foundation for everything:
![background image](assets/images/zimmerBack.webp)

### Wireframes
This time I've used balsamic for an overall, feel, color schemes and just the theme and overall design of the page.

This is the tree structure of my idea
![Balsamic Wireframe Tree Structure](assets/docs/wireframe-tree-structure.png)

This is the first prototype on how i wanted the design of the quiz.

- I've gotten inspired from the love-running project but wrote all the code myself.
- I might've been inspired but all the code and ideas where my own and I've coded all myself.
- When I google'd or searched for something i never copied but wrote it properly myself to fit my own project.

### Content
- All the content is written by me.
- README.md was inspired by links above but not copied nor plagiarized.
- TESTING.md was inspired by links above but not copied nor plagiarized.
- I might've been inspired and impacted by certain credits and sources to write README and TESTING, but everything is reworked to fit my own project the best.

## Final Thoughts and Comments
- At the start I actually had done quite a bit and realized i hadn't commit anything so i remade the project from scratch to be able to commit at the same time when doing the project and not manufacture them later on.

- I probably ended up rebuilding the project 10-20 times not being happy. Started with different designs, single page, multi page, single page again. Colors and no gray scale etc. The journey has been quite long but it has been very teachable and fun in the end.
